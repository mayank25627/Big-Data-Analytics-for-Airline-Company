2024-05-04," We have booked for Premium Economy class. When we were doing online checkin 48 hrs before the flight, we could not get a reserved seat in Premium Economy. We thought that it may be a system error but when went to the airport counter, Air India personnel said that the flight did not have Premium Economy. Also the attendant was very rude. Even if they knew it a couple of days before, they did not intimated it to us. We are still waiting for the reimbursement of this change from Air India. This is not the customer service we expect.",0
2024-04-30,"  I had a terrible customer service experience with the ground staff. They were very rude and uncooperative, lacking basic manners. It seemed like they didnâ€™t care when I asked for the complaints procedure and policy, as no one was aware of it. After insisting, they provided a complaint book with no explanation of the procedure.",0
2024-04-29,  Worst airline even to fly business class. Had approval to carry pet but refused to board because of excess 6kg. Worst Staff behaviour. Not helping at all.,0
2024-04-27,"   I will not fly Air India. Both legs of my flight had no in flight entertainment, so 15 hours each way. My big issue is how they charge for bags being over weight. They generously give free checked bags, but they weighed my carry ons boarding the flight and said I had to pay over 10,000 rupees to board as my bags were over weight. How greedy and petty.",0
2024-04-27,"  For this early morning flight, I had opted to show up on the weekend hoping that the load on this flight would not be as full as they normally would be over the weekends. The check in supervisor was kind and thankfully there were couple of seats available where I could get a seat onboard. The boarding started on time and the crew onboard was pretty friendly. For breakfast had opted for the egg omelet with hash browns which was fine along with tea. Arrival into CCU was also good and timely. Baggage retrieval was also good. Overall a good flight.",1
2024-04-21,"  Check in smooth, Staff at CDG airport Paris were cooperative. Boarding smooth and easy Crew. Average, not as pleasing as I would expect from India. Needs to improve to make the travellers feel cared. Meal too hot to my taste.  Desserts were of poor quality. IFE touch screen was not working. No WiFi onboard. Meal didn't fully match the menu provided on Air India mobile app. Smooth Transfer at Delhi",2
2024-04-19," Air India: A Nightmare of Unresponsive Customer Service. Dealing with Air India has been nothing short of a nightmare. While they did answer my initial calls, their promise of a callback was nothing but empty words, leaving me stranded without assistance. After over ten phone calls and spending more than ten hours on hold, they finally claimed to have found a flight for me and confirmed the booking. However, it turned out to be a lie. They falsely claimed that EL AL had canceled their part of the flight, when in reality, they hadn't. This deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation. Their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine, as required by law, further compounded the issue. Despite repeated attempts to seek help, I was met with indifference and a lack of solutions. Air India's customer service is simply unacceptable. Save yourself the hassle and choose an airline that values its customers.",2
2024-04-18,"   Absolutely ridiculous customer service! Never fly Air India. After they canceled my flight and provided me with an unsuitable solution on a different day they also had a gut to demand money because of fare differences and when I didn't agree and wanted to speak with somebody senior they disconnected my call. Better go for a proper low cost, at least you know what to expect",0
2024-04-16,   Absolutely pathetic. No working entertainment or even a working overhead light for a 9 hour flight! Only vodka or whiskey to drink. No diet coke. Cabin crew ok. The first and last time I ever use Air India!,0
