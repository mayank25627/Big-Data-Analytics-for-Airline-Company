2024-05-04,"I was not looking forward to this 16+ hours flight but I should not have worried because the flight turned out to be 'short' in the end. The cabin was comfortable, the food was diverse, plentiful and well presented. The crew were very nice!",1
2024-04-30,"  Always love Emirates- comfortable legroom and seat with great staff. The flight had a stopover in Cyprus before hitting Dubai and had the row to myself- not that many people on the flight. Good entertainment and comfortable flight",1
2024-04-29, "Flew from Manchester to Mauritius via Dubai. Flight was ok but if you are going to go for seats near front of plane downstairs, do not sit in at side of stairs on left, as staff use a room under the stairs which if it is at night when you are trying to sleep can be disturbing. We sat both downstairs and upstairs in economy but it was very disappointing to pay the prices for the seats. You could not book extra legroom or front row seats but when you got on the flight they were not booked or taken. Staff were nice and helpful. In flight entertainment was very good - good choice of films and programmes to watch",1
2024-04-27," We booked economy as we are not loaded by any means but we always ask when we get the airport anyway they had overbooked economy and had an amazing deal on business class so we upgraded and it was incredible upstairs on the plane lay flat bed champagne on tap proper cutlery and china glassware etc the service was amazing they even had a stand up bar area so you could mingle and get a change of scenery food on demand it really was worth it just wish we could fly like that all the time",1
2024-04-27,"  This was our first time flying with Emirates and we found it quite good. We had enough leg room for our 14 hr flight and the toilets were kept very clean. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Meals supplied were also very good and we certainly didn't go hungry. Check in staff were excellent also. Free internet for 2 hours worked ok...abit hit and miss but ok. Our flight over and our flight back were both quite comfortable.",1
2024-04-21,"  Check in smooth, Staff at CDG airport Paris were cooperative. Boarding smooth and easy Crew. Average, not as pleasing as I would expect from India. Needs to improve to make the travellers feel cared. Meal too hot to my taste.  Desserts were of poor quality. IFE touch screen was not working. No WiFi onboard. Meal didn't fully match the menu provided on Air India mobile app. Smooth Transfer at Delhi",1
2024-04-19," After being taken ill in Bali and a ruined holiday the highlight of the whole experience was being repatriated on Emirates business class which was recommended to the insurance company by a neurologist at Bali hospital. I have flown Emirates many times and have never been disappointed but sadly could never afford to travel business class .Despite being very unwell the experience was amazing....such comfort, attention from flight attendants, and fabulous food was something I will never forget.Being able to use the beautiful lounges and the effortless boarding was indeed a great help. Thank you Emirates for turning such a disaster into a very enjoyable experience.Do hope some day (probably when I win the lottery) I will be able to do the trip again in happier circumstances.",1
2024-04-18,"   We were booked on a Qantas flight number, but it was Emirates operating the service. A 3 hour flight across the Tasman. Very comfortable in business class. The furniture is a but chunky, but it provides much more privacy in the business class seats than you get on other airlines. Good service, with nice food. The crew are a little wooden/frosty, but they do a perfectly good job. Didn't use the flight entertainment other to follow the route of the plane. We like travelling on the A380, which Emirates have quite a few of. We like Emirates, and would fly them more often if we could get Qantas codeshare flights on their flights more often (we are QF frequent flyers and cannot get status credits on Emirates flight numbers). Emirates can also be a bit expensive.",1
2024-04-16,   "The trip was in an A380, the leg space was great, better than standard Boeing 737. The food was good quality and service quite professional but a little bit distant (may be too professional). Entertainment was good and devices worked as expected.",1
