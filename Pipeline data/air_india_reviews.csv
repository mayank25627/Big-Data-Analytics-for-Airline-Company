2024-04-30,"  I had a terrible customer service experience with the ground staff. They were very rude and uncooperative, lacking basic manners. It seemed like they didn’t care when I asked for the complaints procedure and policy, as no one was aware of it. After insisting, they provided a complaint book with no explanation of the procedure."
2024-04-29,  Worst airline even to fly business class. Had approval to carry pet but refused to board because of excess 6kg. Worst Staff behaviour. Not helping at all.
2024-04-27,"   I will not fly Air India. Both legs of my flight had no in flight entertainment, so 15 hours each way. My big issue is how they charge for bags being over weight. They generously give free checked bags, but they weighed my carry ons boarding the flight and said I had to pay over 10,000 rupees to board as my bags were over weight. How greedy and petty."
2024-04-27,"  For this early morning flight, I had opted to show up on the weekend hoping that the load on this flight would not be as full as they normally would be over the weekends. The check in supervisor was kind and thankfully there were couple of seats available where I could get a seat onboard. The boarding started on time and the crew onboard was pretty friendly. For breakfast had opted for the egg omelet with hash browns which was fine along with tea. Arrival into CCU was also good and timely. Baggage retrieval was also good. Overall a good flight."
2024-04-21,"  Check in smooth, Staff at CDG airport Paris were cooperative. Boarding smooth and easy Crew. Average, not as pleasing as I would expect from India. Needs to improve to make the travellers feel cared. Meal too hot to my taste.  Desserts were of poor quality. IFE touch screen was not working. No WiFi onboard. Meal didn't fully match the menu provided on Air India mobile app. Smooth Transfer at Delhi"
2024-04-19," Air India: A Nightmare of Unresponsive Customer Service. Dealing with Air India has been nothing short of a nightmare. While they did answer my initial calls, their promise of a callback was nothing but empty words, leaving me stranded without assistance. After over ten phone calls and spending more than ten hours on hold, they finally claimed to have found a flight for me and confirmed the booking. However, it turned out to be a lie. They falsely claimed that EL AL had canceled their part of the flight, when in reality, they hadn't. This deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation. Their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine, as required by law, further compounded the issue. Despite repeated attempts to seek help, I was met with indifference and a lack of solutions. Air India's customer service is simply unacceptable. Save yourself the hassle and choose an airline that values its customers."
2024-04-18,"   Absolutely ridiculous customer service! Never fly Air India. After they canceled my flight and provided me with an unsuitable solution on a different day they also had a gut to demand money because of fare differences and when I didn't agree and wanted to speak with somebody senior they disconnected my call. Better go for a proper low cost, at least you know what to expect"
2024-04-16,   Absolutely pathetic. No working entertainment or even a working overhead light for a 9 hour flight! Only vodka or whiskey to drink. No diet coke. Cabin crew ok. The first and last time I ever use Air India!
2024-04-14,"  For this late afternoon flight the boarding started on time and for snacks option there was chhole kulche along with dessert and tea/coffee. For the non veg option there was chicken with noodles. The flight itself was pretty uneventful and landed at BLR on time, but noted that the baggage took a bit of time to arrive at the carousel but otherwise for the price that was paid this was a pretty routine flight"
2024-04-14,"  I opted for this midweek flight hoping there would be enough seats which at the check in thankfully there was. The staff supervisor there was very friendly and helped me when my boarding pass was unable to get scanned at the security at BLRs T2 gate, she assisted me in getting through the security and also dealing with some passengers who were in front of me during check in. The flight was quite nice that had dinner service on board. Had opted for the chicken dish that came along with rice and stuff parathas which was good. Arrival was on time and so was baggage retrieval ."
2024-04-12,"  How do you feel when the pilot makes an announcement shortly after the plane has started taxiing and points out a technical problem with the air conditioning that will hopefully be solved during the flight? Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week. Here, too, the decision was made: No more Air India. After a lengthy back and forth with Air India, we were granted around 120 euros in compensation for both passengers. With a total flight price of almost 1,800 euros, this was an outrage."
2024-04-11,"  I travelled with my wife on Air India from Delhi to Newark via Mumbai. I must say that the service from Crew members were flawless. The crew is Professional, Polite, Courteous. The food was flavorful and plentiful. Yes granted the aircrafts were 10 to 15 years old but they were clean. One way my IFE was not working."
2024-04-09,   Old Etihad plane completely worn out. IFE not working at least half of cabin. Broken tables. Broken toilets. Have flown Air India for some bizarre reason for 10 years. Will not fly on them again.
2024-04-08," Terrible experience, super old Aircraft, dirty everywhere, flight attendants tried their best to make sure that everyone was happy. Never flying with them again. In Delhi airport at boarding time representatives of Air India asked me to pay 800USD for a Duty Free bag, however post terminal doesn’t work and they tried to ask for cash. They said any cash amount. I didn’t pay and they allowed us to board last minute."
2024-04-07,"   Air India is a shame to India, being a national carrier they are the disgrace to the country. My mother, who is a senior citizen and was operated recently was not provided with wheel chair services at Toronto airport even after booking in advance and asking for multiple times at the airport itself."
2024-04-06,"  In March of 2024 I flew multiple international and domestic (India) flights with Air India. All flights were sold as “Business Class”. The Delhi to SFO plane was old, my seat was neither comfortable and the controls did not work. The food was pathetic and to top it off the flight attendants were not in any way attentive. Requests for food or drinks were either ignored or required two or three requests and up to a fifty minute wait time. The flight attendants were either not properly trained, over worked or simply did not care about passengers. Nothing one expects to be found in “Business Class” was apparent with Air India. In fact in my experience most domestic United States carriers premium economy far surpass anything I experienced with Air India Business Class on an international flight."
2024-04-03,"  I was travelling on the morning flight from CCU to BOM and had bought this ticket at a discount rate and even though the flight was on the fuller side I was able to get through. Boarding started a bit late and we were in the aircraft for almost an hour due to the ATC congestion. For breakfast had opted for the veg option that included parathas with sabzi, a croissant along with yogurt and beverages. Landing was on time and baggage retrieval was swift. Overall had a good experience for the price that was paid."
2024-04-01,"  I flew from AMS - Delhi / Delhi AMS in both flights I had the same bad experience. Would not recommend. Legroom poor, Entertainment was not working for the entire economy cabin. Air-conditioning not working, pilot had to apologize for the inconvenience. Disorganized boarding experience. No Wifi."
2024-03-29,"  I recently traveled Business Class from London to Mumbai. Throughout the journey, I observed a significant disparity between the two sides of the plane. On one side, passengers were promptly served snacks, juice, and amenities kits, while the other side seemed to receive less attention. As a paying Business Class traveler, this inconsistency was quite evident and left me perplexed. Whenever I requested assistance from the flight attendants, their standard reply was, “We’ll take care of it for your side later.” Unfortunately, these assurances rarely translated into action. Whether it was headphones, desserts, or other amenities, the promised items often failed to materialize. Strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances. Keeping track of items served to each passenger is essential. After all, we all paid for the same Business Class experience, and it’s disheartening to see such discrepancies."
2024-03-27,  Worst trip in a business class ever. Unable to flatten seat owing to mechanical failure and in flight entertainment was completely off the entire 17 hr flight. Wheelchair assistance was poor at both Delhi and Vancouver.
2024-03-21,"  Worst experience! Food was awful, cabin crew were not very friendly, lights in the airline were switched off for most of the flight time, entertainment monitors did not work for most of the flight and delayed flight made me miss the connecting international flight. Flight staff at the Delhi Airport were even worse."
2024-03-16, Worst airline I have travelled on. Flights are delayed because they don't have staff to check in passengers.  Staff hardly speak English and they don't understand. They would change the gates any time without announcing on the speaker. Their staff came and spoke in his language to a passenger that the gate has change.
2024-03-16,"  I check in into terminal 2 of airport properly as per ticket so not only me but along with me several families were misguided to go to gate 6 and 7. After we enter the gate there is no representative of Air India to guide us, people were late on top of it security gate delay and than no one responsible person. The staff tells us this is domestic counter you go to international and no body of their staff knows where is this international counter all clueless people ok after that people some how reach the international counter. The moment we go 5 to 10 mins before the reporting time their staff informs the flight is closed and you'll will have to go to managers. They give us big lecture on time and all so we told them we were already there on time your staff misguided us on wrong gate. They are very very good at telling you your duties but they are unprofessional and uncooperative people."
2024-03-15,"  The worst airline in the world I was traveling from Dubai to Delhi and Air India lost my luggage. First they said Dubai didn’t send which was a lie, because Dubai airport sent on same day. After they was telling me we don’t know where is your luggage."
2024-03-14,"   Travelled 1st March London to Thiruvanthapuram via Mumbai. Also on 8th March Thiruvanthapuram to Delhi and then to Amristsar. Then return to Thiruvanthapuram on 10th and flew back to London via Mumbai on 12th. So multiple flights (8) in 1-2days. The staff were great, no issues very customer focused, food quality and taste excellent on board. Excellent leg room and seats comfortable. I noticed a few passengers had screens not working. The only issue we had was during transfer from Mumbai to Thiruvanthapuram at Mumbai airport it was like a cattle market - complete lack of order and no queuing system, Air India staff screeching at passengers waiting to check in their luggage again. That definitely needs improving! Other than that the check in staff were very courteous and polite. Air India personnel at Thiruvanthapuram-exceptional. Definitely will fly with Air India again."
2024-03-10,"  Old aircraft. Most of the IFE were out of order, even after rebooting. One passenger whose IFE worked said the IFE was exactly the same as 9 years ago when the 787 arrived for Air India. Toilets dirty. No call buttons & light buttons. In trying to read, I had to catch the attention of a flight attendant who passed by. She had to turn it on via the wall mount behind the crew seat for me. The same happened when I wanted to have the light turned off. It was a dilapidated aircraft in need of refurbishment. The 12.5 hour flight felt very long, as there was no IFE. Food was of meagre portion. One small tray of main plus 2 small cartons of side dessert. It was a very unenjoyable flight. Seat very hard, tailbone hurt after sitting for a long time. Instead of 8 abreast, AI uses a 9 abreast configuration."
2024-03-10,"  Aircraft newer than the one of the previous trip, but not refurbished. IFE worked. After take off, a hot snack/supper served, with 2 choices, veg & non veg, then breakfast / lunch. Portion standard. Toilets cleaner than the previous flight. 9 abreast configuration makes aisles very narrow. Seat a bit hard,. Did not use call button, but supposed there was none. No light button for reading too. Also like the fact that after the flight, I was surprised the flight attendant did not collect the food trays in order. She collected them in her own order. It took a long time for her to collect mine. Shortly after I sat down in my seat, in seeing that I had a head dressing due to injury, the flight attendant asked if I needed any help."
2024-03-06,  It was the worst international flight experience. I booked with Air India for my parents considering that it will be the best Airlines for senior Indian citizen. I was wrong. First the flight was late more than 2 hours.  I had requested for wheel chair assistance at Delhi airport but they never received that assistance.
2024-03-05," Nothing was working: no screen, no movies, no music, no light, staff very unpolite, food very bad. And very expensive ticket, for what you get, better to use other airlines."
2024-03-05,"  The travel with air India came up being a nightmare that might haunt me in the future travels as well. There were so many big issues that I am writing this review so you do not have to go through the same thing I did. Too crowded and unhygienic.  For a flight of 12 hours we did not anything to entertain because the screen for almost half of flight was not working. Flights was delayed for almost 3 hours with no transparent information and from the beginning the delay time was 20 minutes which added up to almost 3 hours. Due to delay we lost our next flight which was also via air India and the staff at Delhi airport tried every possible way to make us find our own accommodation and even asked us to lie at Indian immigration parrotting us to tell we want to visit Delhi not the real reason that we had to get out as they couldn’t provide us accommodation within the airport premises which ended up creating a discussion and kind of scene. When I arrived to Kathmandu airport, I had missing baggage and its still missing. Only good thing was the crew team members ”air hostess “ were humble and helpful Avoid trouble avoid Air India"
2024-03-04," I have been helped by the reviews here, so decided to share my experience from Washington DC to Kathmandu via Delhi. Flight time/duration and price was just too tempting to give AI a try and I am glad I tried them. I find their economy seats comfortable and good decent service. However, restrooms cleanliness can be improved. I did not care about entertainment system, so no comment on that. Hope Air India keeps improving. I will fly with them again."
2024-03-03,"  Worst flight, no inflight entertainment (screen doesn't work). No navigation in 15 hrs flight. Seats don't recline. Cannot call air hostess as buttons don't wor.k Washroom so so dirty and they don't even clean after few hours of flight. Overall very old and dirty plane. Not recommended at all. Avoid if you can. Its very bad experience"
2024-02-20,"  We had a flight on Air India departing Delhi on a Saturday at 15:20, supposed to arrive in San Francisco at 18:20. Air India first changed our flight just hours before departure, they then changed it again later in the day. The flight was not cancelled for weather, war, or acts of God. No reason was ever given. After the changes, we were finally boarded on a different flight departing Monday afternoon, 2 days later. All during this time, Air India didn't offer any kind of compensation; no meals, no lodging, no nothing. We had to stay at a hotel 2 nights at our own expense. We wrote to Air India and explained the situation, asking they pay for the hotel and meals. They wrote back ""In the case of your booking to SFO we humbly convey to you that you were given alternate flight and that you travelled till your final destination"". NO mention of the 2 nights at a hotel we had to pay for. If they would have delayed us for a month, would we still be liable to pay for our food and lodging!?!"
2024-02-17,  Very third class services of air India. We were in the line at 3.45 am to the airport for 5am flight there was no call given by that supervisor. only 2 people were at the counter. That lady was very unprofessional and not well mannered. She had not accepted our tickets we had to cancel it.  Very disappointed. Horror experience
2024-02-16,"  I am extremely dissatisfied with Air India. Despite my family repeatedly warning me not to travel with AI, I thought of giving it a try. On my way from DEL to LHR , my inflight entertainment did not work. This has been such a common complaint from my relatives hence they warned me. I pressed the call attendant button but they would just turn off the sign. I pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end. Frustrated I went to cabin crew area where they were just talking. I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work. They asked me to sit. 5 mins later, a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours, I could sleep during this time. I told her yes I would sleep but no one should be commanding what time I do what. She said maybe I can give feedback as none of Air India inflight entertainment systems work in any plane."
2024-02-13,  The airline is part of the Star Alliance but is not an airline that lives up to the normal standard. The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours. When I asked for compensation of 600 Euros (not for a full refund) they changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues!
2024-02-11,"  It’s a bad experience. The flight timing was 22.40pm on 11th Feb from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. But they changed timing as 12.30 on 12th Feb, 1.40am and then 2am. But still not sure when they will depart. It’s so disappointing. And for the delayed refreshment they are not proving any Coffe or tea. And providing only specific meal with smallest water bottle."
2024-02-11, Had a very good experience. Very polite cabin crew. We were travelling with a child and they were very helpful. Food was great. On time arrival and liberal baggage policy for international routes compared to American and European airlines. Clean flight and good enough in flight entertainment
2024-02-08,"  Cancelled flight Hyderabad-Delhi-Paris. My wife, my daughter and I arrived at Hyderabad airport at 3a.m. on January 15 2024 we saw that our flight AI 559 to Delhi had been cancelled, we received an email at the same time. We tried to get information and find a solution during 6 hours at the airport, no one could find a solution for us or give us reliable information. 6 hours waiting at the airport from 3am until 9am for nothing. Then in the afternoon, one Indian friend helped us calling Air India, we managed to schedule the cancelled flight by Air India for 2 days later, on January 17. The plane we took from Delhi to Paris was horrible, dirty and old, entertainment system was not working, the food was horrible. Air India refused to give us a commercial gesture and compensation for all these inconveniences."
2024-02-05,"  Our worst flying experience. My wife and I were flying Air India from Ahmedabad to Newark via Mumbai. Our first flight was delayed (from 8:25 pm to 9:25pm) and we were informed just a few hours before. After arriving at the airport, we were told that our connecting flight form Mumbai to Newark has been cancelled and that we would have to fly to JFK in NY instead. We insisted that we would prefer to fly to Newark but no one could guarantee us a seat to Newark even a few days later. We were told no flight could be seen in the near future and that we should take the flight to JFK. Well, the flight from Ahmedabad was not delayed by an hour, it did not depart for another hour and a half (@ 11 pm). By then, we had been at the airport for 5 hours but no one offered us any food vouchers or water. After arriving in Mumbai, we had a heck of a time getting to the gate due to the distance and security check, etc. The flight to JFK was scheduled at 1:45 am and we were sure we couldn’t make that! Even worse than that is the fact that while we were trying to reach our gate, we heard an announcement for an Air India flight leaving for Newark!!! We were lied to about the Newark flight being cancelled and bumped onto another flight which reaches at an airport that is another hour away form Newark. We did not receive any prior notification as with the first flight but were surprised at the check-in counter. Meanwhile, the flight to JFK was delayed by a little over an hour and finally left at 3:00 am with us on it. We had to make other arrangements to get home and it cost us more money!! There was no talk of any compensation for inconvenience or any other options by Air India."
2024-02-04," Delhi to Dubai, flight AI 995. It was a fabulous experience, I have been a club Vistara and Singapore Airlines traveller for many years, have been a platinum member for many years, but my experience today travelling business class from Delhi to Dubai has been fabulous. From the check in, boarding, the in flight experience, the ambience, and not to forget the courtesy of the staff has been amazing, it exceeded my expectations. Have been doing business class for a long time, never had expected air india to be this special. Definitely my next flight is Air India for sure, and many more to come for sure."
2024-02-02,"  We travelled by Air India twice in January between Mumbai and Rajkot in January 2024. Excellent crew, polite and professional, the pilots explained why flights were slightly delayed. Although the flights were only about an hour long the cabin crew provided a sandwich, small carton of fruit juice and a small bottle of water. Comfortable seats, adequate leg space and usb port to charge phone after flight has departed."
2024-02-01,"  Absolutely the worst flight I have ever been on. Was on the Toronto to Delhi direct flight and got a swift realization why I will never book to fly with Air India again. I was flying with 3 others that all needed special wheelchair assistance, so in order to even check-in we had to wait in line first before they would even allow them to sit in the wheelchair area. Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience. However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India. For a direct long haul flight I cannot believe the condition of the airplane. The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties. The bathrooms were disgusting and also falling apart. The icing on the cake was a 13.5 hr flight with no inflight entertainment and being told they cannot fix it. See all the pics for what you are getting into if you choose to fly Air India."
2024-01-30,"  My worst flying experience was this international transit flight from Mumbai to Bangkok. The aircraft was infested with mosquitoes when passengers boarded. The cramped leg space left me uncomfortable, and despite the efforts of the flight crew, the situation remained unaddressed. The seats were not comfortable for long-distance travel. Based on this experience, I would not consider traveling with Air India again, nor would I recommend it to others."
2024-01-26,"  A very bad experience. It was a 12.5 hr flight from Delhi to Sydney. Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed. Basically I had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without TV. I had no option left but go to sleep. first long wait for check in ; second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no TV"
2024-01-14,"  I recently traveled business class with my daughter and elderly mom, and my experience with Air India left much to be desired. Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option. Exploring alternatives was impractical due to last-minute expenses from other airlines and the urgency of an expiring visa the next day. Despite the hospitality and care provided by the cabin staff during the flight, the numerous issues encountered throughout the journey overshadow this positive note."
2024-01-13," I had mixed feelings as I booked this flight, due to the many negative reviews on this page, but on the contrary I held optimism for Air India since the Tata takeover. I booked this trip (WLG to STV via MEL and DEL, 1st leg operated by Qantas, last leg by Air India Express) as it was almost half the price as other airlines on this route, but also because I wanted to give Air India a go again. Honestly, I had a very pleasant experience. The check in process, baggage handling, comfort, boarding, cleanliness, ground and cabin crew, food and service were all excellent - on par with what you'd usually expect with the likes of Singapore Airlines. Crew member Pranali on MEL-DEL flight on 12 Jan was particularly kind, attentive and excellent at her job. Honestly I'd fly this airline again. As an Indian based abroad I would always prefer to fly an airline which feels like home as soon as you board and honestly I had no complaints."
2024-01-10,"  Third class experience. All seats torn, cloth of pockets as well as seats. Looks like a state transport bus. Never travel with air India. Total waste of your money"
2024-01-07,"  My experience was nothing short of amazing, thanks to the outstanding service provided by the airline's dedicated team. From the outset, the ground staff at Mumbai Airport showed an exceptional level of support. The efficiency and warmth exhibited during the check-in process by the executive at the counter set a positive tone for the journey. I was pleased to find myself in a new and well-maintained plane. The seating was comfortable, and the cleanliness of the cabin was impressive. The culinary offerings were delicious. The diverse meal options and attention to taste were much appreciated. One of the highlights of my journey was the exemplary service provided by the guest relations team, which included Chhaya, Yash, and ABBU. Their dedication to ensuring passenger comfort and satisfaction was evident in every interaction."
2024-01-06,"  This is not even a comfort issue. When an airline thinks it's OK to put a plane into service for a 14-hour long haul fight where the seats are falling apart, many tray tables were, loose on hinges and can't stay up when opened and barely latched when closes; and emergency floatation devices were detached from under the seat and on the ground. Most of the TV screens not working. I have 3 more legs on my travel plans, this is just very terrible how they're getting away with it!"
2024-01-03,  I was pleasantly surprised by the new A320Neo this time and it was clean and comfortable seats. The seat included a cup holder and a phone holder and the seats have USB Charging points. This flight  had great crew and refreshment service which included a snack box. I asked for one more sandwich and the crew gave me another snack box which I appreciate. Overall a great short flight and I'm very impressed by Air India and would fly them again.
2024-01-03,"  Air India allows 25kg check in Baggage which I feel is very generous. I loved my experience onboard despite a 16 year old aircraft, A kind crew and delicious snack box made this short flight very comfortable."
2024-01-02,"  Avoid like a Plague. We booked tickets at 3 times the normal price due to black dates of travel which offered us very little flexibility. Old worn aircraft, non functional entertainment screens, rude ground staff, seat recline not working, no time management. There was not even one leg of journey where the flight was not delayed by 3 hours. Last leg from Hyd- Del- LHR was the nail in coffin. For Hyd to Del leg, passengers were asked to board after 2 hours delay and then asked to sit in Aircraft further for 1.30 hours. The ground staff and flight supervisor told repeatedly to connecting 27 passengers (to London Heathrow) that connecting flight from Delhi AI 165 is waiting to accommodate them. To our shock, the flight had departed 50 mins before we landed. The whole ground staff is rude. Eventually after so much fight for a place to reach final destination, we boarded AI 161 after 13 hours of actual departure (of AI 165) from New Delhi and have just arrived in LHR. We faced 16 hours delay on a 11.5 hours travel."
2023-12-29,  Don't ever fly Air India. Both my flights were delayed. One by 5 hours the other by 7 hours and they didn't give any information or water or food and the food on the flight was disgusting too. Their delays meant I spent 25 dollars in the airport and still they offered zero compensation.  Everything about this airline is disgusting.
2023-12-25,"  The flight was delayed by some 4 hours (delays by Air India are very common) from YVR. When the flight took off, I noticed my seat was not very clean, but ok. The flight attendants served a tasty meal (no issues here) and then the next service was around 4-5 hours later. No attendants were seen anywhere. I went to the back galley, no one was there. I called the attendant by pressing the button, still nobody came. My reason was that my entertainment console was not working. On top of this, the lady seated on the aisle (in was window seat) was now taking up the aisle and middle seat and her head was almost on my lap. Wasn't happy about this and I had to ask her to keep her distance. Other than the food, did not enjoy the flight."
2023-12-24,"  Save yourself by not booking with Air India. They cancelled our flight just 2 hours prior from Delhi to New York. No apologies or any kind of sensible solution was provided, instead they gave us the worst possible alternate flight i.e Fly from Delhi to Singapore with layover of 6hours and Singapore to New York. Which we didnt opt and had to re-book through an actual reliable flight which bought us home comfortably and safely."
2023-12-24,"   Awful, just awful - never again. If you are considering flying this airline, think again. The personal entertainment systems never work. This is my second time flying with them and found exactly the same problem. This like torture for 19 hour of flying. They tell you they will try to restart the console, but this is just an excuse as one of the attendants told me that 70% of the don’t work and they don’t try to fix them. Then, my transit flight’s time was changed from a 15 hour layover to 21 hours without any explanation. Delhi airport is not great for long transit. This also caused me to miss out on spending Christmas with my family. When I complained, no one from the airline seemed interested or even cared. Terrible service, terrible airline."
2023-12-24,"  AI 537 was cancelled on 23rd December 23, on 24th December 30min of boarding time, they announced due to maintenance issues the flight will not take off. At 4:15pm they announced change of gate from 30 to 42B and displayed the flight will fly tentatively at 5:45pm. How can an airline make such a big blunder when people are traveling to celebrate Christmas with family and friends. Worst experience and wouldn't recommend this nasty airline."
2023-12-19,"  A below average, stress-inducing experience on a 16-hour direct flight. I paid ~$2200 for an economy seat on a direct flight from San Francisco to Delhi.  The frame of the seat in front of me had two cracks that went all the way through the frame of the back support.  Do not expect a comfortable seat. Do not expect the seat to recline. Do not expect to fit in your seat if your hips exceed 39 inches. Do not expect your food to be cooked well. Do not expect a functioning entertainment console. If you’re traveling with children, good luck. Do not expect an outlet and latest USB charging ports. Do not expect world-class service in economy. I do not recommend you fly with Air India."
2023-12-12," I had a horrible experience, they over booked the flight I was supposed to fly on and had me fly through an extra 9 hrs and inconvenience of transferring luggage plus a very paltry compensation of $100 for an inconvenient international flight. I highly suggest to fly another carrier, but not Air India."
2023-12-12,"  Flew JFK-HYD-JFK between 26-Nov-23 and 11-Dec-23. The onward journey was quite disappointing with a dilapidated aircraft. The tray tables were falling apart and had to be carefully assembled into place and up. Though there were seat back screens, only very few lucky passengers enjoyed any IFE but none in my row. The crew offered some inane apology and reset the server but there wasn't any improvement. But for my backup on my phone, it would have been an excruciating 15 hours to Delhi which the passenger next to me endured. Of the three meals served, two were almost the same. The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession. The toilets deteriorate rapidly as the flight progresses ending up as unusable as the flight nears the destination. Can the crew please provide enough TP for the entire flight?  Overall it was a disappointing experience but for the friendly crew that toils away despite the heavy odds against them."
2023-12-05," Travelled on 20th Nov 20023 back on 4th Dec 2023 from Singapore to Bangalore return. While going flight was delayed by 14 hrs, coming back 5 hrs. No early information on delay while coming back. Stayed in the airport for alomost 6 hrs waiting. Suggest not to travel by this plane if you have another airline connecting flight."
2023-12-02,  Worst airline ever. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and finally after boarding the flight hasn't left the gate for 2 hours now. The captain just mentioned that it's a technical issue. No food was offered. Also the airline was out of blankets and no inflight entertainment for international flights.
2023-11-28,"  I booked a flight from JFK to Kathmandu for February of 2024 in October 2023, but unfortunately had to cancel the flight within 24 hours and book via another airline. When I cancelled, I received a cancellation confirmation email from Air India confirm the flight was cancelled and I would receive a 100% refund for cancelling in a timely manner. However, two weeks later, I had not received any refund. I reached out to Air India's customer service and they insisted I never cancelled the flight. I was passed between multiple representatives and finally told to create a Case. I did so, including all documentation, and followed up with Air India two more times. The second time, a representative confirmed I would receive a 100% refund within 24 hours. No refund ever came - I followed up multiple times, and never received any further responses other than insisting I cancel myself via their online portal, which would cost me $700 for a bogus cancellation fee. I did nothing wrong in this scenario, and yet Air India is attempting to profit $700 from me, in nothing less than criminal fashion."
2023-11-27, The worst experience ever flying Air India return direct flight from Melbourne to Delhi and back from Delhi to Melbourne. It is a 12 hours flight and the infotainment system wasn’t working for both the flights. How unprofessional is that and what a rip off. How are you supposed to pass time without the infotainment system.
2023-11-25,"  I had very high hopes of a turn around for this airline but very disappointing experience to say the least. THE GOOD 1. Check in experience was pleasant throughout my trip 2. I was lucky my flight was on time THE TERRIBLE 1. Aircraft not clean, dirty toilets, tray table and stained seats 2. Entertainment system not working throughout the flight (10 hour flight) 3. Terrible food quality 4. No wifi and the plan interiors look run down 5. Inexperienced, young and rude staff 6. Severely damaged bags 7. No boarding groups, free for all first come first serve 8. Pushing, shoving included in the ticket price."
2023-11-23,"  I didn't have a good experience with Air India (AI173). The seats were uncomfortable, and none of the screens worked so had no entertainment whatsoever in a 15 hours long flight. The customer service was terrible. When you ask for something from staff they won't ever come back to you. I had to go all the way back to get the water I asked for. The staff was very rude. I was given a link to review that didn't even work. Will never ever travel through this airline again."
2023-11-23,  I took a domestic flight from Agartala to Kolkata for my international travel the same day and I was solo travelling with a 15 month old baby. I was slightly worried or had my anticipations for how things will go. But the staff had done a marvellous job up make my trip as comfortable as it can get. Specially “Mr. Avishek Dhar” helped me a lot by managing my luggage to make it through travel till JFK so that I have a comfortable trip with the baby. Also baggage allowance for international flight was allowed in domestic flight according to Air India policy. All in all they have done a commendable job to make me go stress free the whole trip. This gives me reason enough to choose air India every time again in future and also let my friends and family know the best services are provided by Air India. Keep going !!Keep up the good work!
2023-11-23,"  I had high hopes for a amazing flight experience, it was anything but that. I was very lucky my flight departed on time. Airport check in process was smooth. Entertainment system was not working. Toilets were very dirty. Food quality was bad. Choice of drinks were terrible. Overall, seats and trays were dirty. Inexperienced and young flight crew, spilled water and not even an apology. They lack the concept of hospitality"
2023-11-22,"  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards."
2023-11-22," I had taken the early morning flight from Bombay as I need to travel here and as I had booked the tickets quite early at a significant discount was hoping to get one of the better seats located in front of the aircraft. To my pleasant surprise I did manage to get an aisle seat located at the front which was good. Boarding was on time and for breakfast I had opted for the veg option which consisted of some stuffed parathas, chole, a croissant along with coffee. The crew were quite nice and soothing and the flight itself landed uneventfully without any issues at its destination."
2023-11-21,"  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life."
2023-11-17,  I will never ever fly again. My requests for special meals were deleted on the way there. Terrible staff. Smelling and dirty aircrafts. Very rude flight attendants. TVs during flight did not work at all on way there and back even after raising this to the crew. Just a terrible experience. Food is extremely spicy but with no taste. My gluten free food was not gluten free. I had terrible digestion problems as they broke my diet. Giving me a croissant when I am on gluten diet and then giving me a brownie which I thought was gluten free but it obviously wasnt due to my body reaction.
2023-11-16," We recently flew with Air India and experienced excellent service like onboard WiFi, excellent legroom and seat comfort, great value for money, friendly crew, weather in cabin was cool and not throwing-up hot, ground staff were polite too, no inflight entertainment though, there was food. Will fly with them again!"
2023-11-12,"   The flight departed on time and was comfortable. The cabin was full, I was looking forward to watching movies and catch up. However, my entertainment console was not working all the time. My chosen movie would start and then ten minutes later it would stop. After repeated attempts, I just gave up and tried to sleep.  Air India disappoints on international routes"
2023-11-12,"  I had the pleasure of flying with Air India, and it was a delightful experience. The in-flight service was top-notch, with attentive attendants ensuring that every need was met promptly. Comfortable seating and ample legroom. The flights departed and arrived on schedule, and the journey felt well-coordinated. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was overwhelmingly positive. Gagandeep (Supervisor) and her team was extremely helpful. They made me feel like Lady Diana. I am grateful to them."
2023-11-11,"  Pathetic airline. Ruining the image of the country. Looks like a government bus. Unkept, dirty seats, delays and what not. Horrible!"
2023-11-11,  Check in was terrible. Took 45 minutes. Long queue of passenger carrying ridiculous amounts of luggage. One group stood in front of an agent for the full 45 minutes we were in the queue apparently waiting for resolution of their mountain of luggage. Leg room the worst I have ever seen for a medium length flight. Fortunately it was 1/3rd full so I could move to a seat with an empty seat next to me. No entertainment at all - 5.5 hours.
2023-11-06,"  Casually denied my seat at the counter due to overbooking. Then manager, seeing I am a single lady flying tries to show his power and raise voice at me. Air India is pathetic. Such cruel customer services will not be accepted. They don't care about the customer, such an arrogant man thinks that just because he is sitting behind desk and has a mere ticket he can do anything say anything, black mail someone in any manner. Such behaviour will never be acceptable. I had a very humiliating experience with this airline."
2023-11-05," I had booked initially on economy class for this flight but was able to upgrade to business as there were a couple of seats available which came at a fee and I really wanted to see how things have changed especially on the business class after the takeover so thought this was a good opportunity. There is a separate counter for business class passengers where the staff was able to courteously check in and provide the lounge access voucher as well. The flight was delayed as the incoming flight was delayed and the crew were able to proactively communicate this fact to the passengers including the arrival of the flight which was good. It seems that even though the seats are quite spacious, this airbus 321 was also showing its signs of ageing as well. The seat also had newspapers / magazines which once could read but there was definitely an upgrade of the soft aspects of the product. On board the crew were welcoming and as a welcome drink there was a choice between buttermilk and coconut water and they have had also given hot towels which was very greatly appreciated as they are quite valuable which was not given before. Also there were menu cards distributed for the dinner option before take off as the crew noted down the orders. Previously the meals options used to be on laminated cards. I had opted for the fish curry with okra and that was quite a good and filling option along with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Unfortunately due to turbulence the crew were unable to do the beverage service which was good. Baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall I feel that the soft product was markedly improved from the last time I flew them in J class including the hot towels and menu cards with greater options but with the induction of new aircraft and refurbishment of cabin interiors I am quite optimistic that the business class product could get even better in the future. Only issue was the delay but that was due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft."
2023-10-29,"  Rubbish airline, the worst I’ve travelled. Infotainment systems don’t work, when you tell the staff about it, they reply “yes we know” . Staff call button is useless, because staff switch it off from their controlled device without attending to check on what you require. Ground Air India staff are the useless and it’s as good as talking to a robot! They’re slow and really unhelpful! Never ever fly this airline, And I’m surprised they’re part of the Star Alliance."
2023-10-27,  My Lufthansa flight was cancelled and I was on rebooked on an Air India flight 119 on Oct 24 2023 from Mumbai to New York. The aircraft's TV was not working. Reading light not working and there was no hand soap in the toilet. I spend the 15 cruel hours looking at the blank TV. There was no way to charge my cell phone. So I could not use my cell phone to pass the time. My experience was horrible and I never expected or experienced such a difficult flight situation. We paid a lot of money to book a ticket for an international flight. I feel Air India should look into this matter and rectify all the short comings of the aircraft.
2023-10-25," Worst experience ever. Staff don't even come to serve water. I pressed for assistance many time and every time they were resetting it. I was travelling with my two kids 5 years and 1 year. When my boy was literally crying for water then we had to share three sips of water among us which is totally unacceptable. Moreover the cleanliness omg. Toilets were so disgusting they didn't even bother to spray the room freshener and our 12 hour 20 min flight was such a nightmare. Moreover, staff didn't even bother to help when I asked her if she can help me putting belt on my baby. She said the other hostess will come but no on came. They were so uninterested in helping like they were doing big favor on for being onboard. I will make sure none of know book this flight ever again. Tv's were not working either. Worst experience ever it was like a never ending nightmare."
2023-10-25,  I had a connecting international flight from Delhi. Airline changed my flight that was not acceptable to me as I would lose my connection. Airline refused to give me alternate flight and said I have to pay extra for flight change. I did not change. They changed my flight. In the end I was just refunded taxes. Air India did not refund my ticket.
2023-10-24,"  We flew business class from Newark to Bombay the comfort, the legroom, and the cleanliness was unspeakable. However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it. It was making me vomiting because it was so bitter and tasted slimy and tasteless. The whole food experience was disgusting."
2023-10-17,"   I recently flew with Air India and wanted to share my experience. The service was good, and the food was okay, but my 8-hour flight was marred by the fact that half of the screens weren't working, leaving me without any entertainment. It made the journey quite hectic, and I'm now concerned about my return flight. Despite assurances from the staff that they would reset the system, no one came back to check if it worked. I'm hesitant to fly with Air India again and wouldn't recommend it to others."
2023-10-16,"   Air India agents were extremely rude and almost got pushed by an agent at the gate owing to some extra weight in carry on. They were unprofessional and unaccommodating. They were bickering at other customers in the line. If given a chance, I’d never fly Air India and would neither recommend it to friends and family. The worst airline to fly."
2023-10-16,   Air India Dubai sector is strictly avoidable. The flights never run on time. Everything sucks. Punctuality. Access to customer care. Ease to cancel tickets. Just nothing is right
2023-10-15," My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation. Air India must take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that passengers receive the services they pay for and are entitled to."
2023-10-13,"   Staff is stubborn with deaf ear. Water is served as if last bottle in the world, hot coffee is cold. Food quality is poor & spicy. Seat monitors don’t function and aircraft are too old. Spend your money on other airlines where people take care of you. My last flight with them."
2023-10-11,"  Flight landed 3 hours 25 mins late at final destination Amritsar airport Punjab. They won’t acknowledge any responsibility and flat deny any sort of compensation. The Aviation authorities clearly state any flight delayed by three hours (unless weather issues) or landing over three hours late is a case for possible compensation. This airline don’t want to communicate, just keep sending you automated emails, nobody will talk to you and more worrying than that is their planes are falling apart, no proper maintenance carried out. I wouldn’t fly with Air India if it was free. Be aware of this airline."
2023-10-09,"   The flight was supposed to take off at 8.25am but due to technical issues it kept getting delayed. The problem here is that there was no clarification from the staff as to what was happening. The flight took off at 12 pm. As per the rules we were supposed to get a free meal but were provided only a bottle of water. The seat of the aircraft was stinking, inflight entertainment system was not working. The staff on the aircraft looked disinterested in doing their job. Not a good experience."
2023-09-30,"  I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent travel experience with Air India. On August 31, 2023, I had booked a flight (AI-309) from Melbourne to Delhi scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM. Unfortunately, this journey turned into a chaotic and inconvenient ordeal due to the cancellation of the flight and the subsequent mismanagement of the situation. The cancellation of the flight itself was a major inconvenience. I had specifically chosen a direct flight for the ease and comfort of traveling with my 3-year-old daughter. The direct flight option was the primary reason for selecting Air India for this trip. However, when I arrived at the airport, I was informed that the flight had been canceled. This abrupt change in plans disrupted my entire travel schedule. To make matters worse, the alternative flight that was offered to us, Sri Lanka Airlines to Colombo, was not only indirect but also experienced significant delays. This unexpected detour further complicated our travel plans and added unnecessary stress to an already frustrating situation. The lack of clear communication and contingency planning was evident throughout this experience. One of the most concerning aspects of this ordeal was the lack of consideration for the well-being of my 3-year-old daughter and me during the extended waiting period. We were forced to wait at the airport for 8 hours, during which no meals were provided for my child. This is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of basic care for passengers, especially young children who rely on a regular meal schedule. The inconvenience caused to my daughter, who was hungry and tired, is deeply distressing. I must express my disappointment with the overall handling of this situation by Air India. As a result of this experience, I have lost faith in the reliability and customer service of your airline. I can assure you that I will not consider Air India for any future travel plans, and I will actively discourage friends and family from doing so as well."
2023-09-29," At the check in counter - I was allowed extra baggage and the person was very sweet. He understood the fact I was travelling for an internship. 10 mins before boarding - I was randomly asked to weigh my bags and to pay 14,000 INR extra because of extra luggage (which was pre-approved). In the end I was charged the money just because the flight had to take off. I do not know if this was a game right from the check-in counter."
2023-09-29,"  I had a very disappointing experience with Air India, I thought after taking over from the Government the service would have improved however, still long check-in queues and unfriendly staff at check-in desks. I had a flight from Delhi to London and my internal flight entertainment system was broken. Sadly, instead of providing support I was told that ”sir I can confirm it won’t work”. Also, I was only allowed 3 can of beers on a 8 hour flight, I was told due to airline regulations they can’t offer me more. I will not fly again with them."
2023-09-28,"  This review is regarding my recent round-trip experience on Air India flights from Toronto to Delhi and back. To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing. It is essential to ensure that passengers are adequately catered to, especially during long-haul flights, where a comfortable and satisfying meal can significantly improve the overall experience."
2023-09-28,  Staff on both flights were poorly trained.  It took them 90 minutes to start the now infamous entertainment system. Meals were average. Tasty. Ground staff in new Delhi the very worst one could meet. I requested a wheelchair. The pusher couldn't find my gate info. Clueless. Transit security was a nightmare. Very poor communication. English is an official language in India?  Not in new Delhi airport. I was taken to the wrong gate and left there. I had no way of moving this chair. Not a self propel wheelchair.  BHX baggage 1 hour I assumed my suitcase was lost. It was removed from the belt! Sitting in a wheelchair gave me no visibility. The wheelchair pusher vanished.  BHX was an awful experience. New Delhi was even worse. The Boeing 787-8 was old. Original fittings.
2023-09-28,"  Our flight was reassigned to another route (our plane to Delhi on September 9th past midnight was given to Mumbai flight), decision was made at the gate. All Delhi passengers were stranded. No lounge or compensation was given. We were then made to fan on our own to fight for the morning 8.30am flight. No assistance was provided. Some did not even get tickets to the 8.30 flight The flight was full. As a result of our 8 hour delay. We missed our connecting flight to Kathmandu. At Delhi, again no arrangements were made for us. We had to do it ourselves and had to ensure our baggages were also rightfully transferred to the new arranged flight more thank 6 hours later -  stranded another 6 hours in Delhi. We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us). In all of this no one apologised. The duty personnel in Changi Airport on the 9th past midnight to early morning 8.30am at the gate were hopeless and offered no sympathy or help. No one from Air India were at the transfer desk at 6am that morning to arrange for the new boarding passes. It was all left to Changi Airport staff to assist (and they were also clueless what was happening.  We were lied that we were to be placed on the 2.40am SQ flight to Delhi. In India upon landing, the Air India staff were clueless too. They even can tell us the midnight flight to Delhi did take off as per their system.  Following this I wrote at least 4 emails to vent my anger. All I received was a cancellation letter of my flight. I had hope and requested for a better treatment of our return flight back to Singapore on the 24th of September from Kathmandu. I received an email 8 hours b4 the flight mentioning my request for some comfort and upgrades will be looked at. At the airport in Kathmandu on 24th I showed to duty manager and supervisor he literally said our requests will be done in Delhi.  In Delhi nothing was done. No one knew nothing and we just gave up by then. By the way what a horrible flight AI382 was, no entertainment system!"
2023-09-26,"  Air India is the most horrible airline I have ever flown. We were on 3 10+ hour flights (with a child) and had no entertainment system that worked. When we asked about it the stewards said that they would check it, they never did. Then I asked again and again, somebody promised us new seats, but never did she come back. It was also very smelly (like urine) in the plane, the light in the toilet didn't work and it would not flush properly. Some of the seats didn't even recline. At the airport in New Delhi staff was very rude and it was very chaotic! I will never ever choose Air India again!"
2023-09-26,"  The food quality has deteriorated no choice, its like we have this take it or leave it, have seen many passengers just avoiding the meals, service is very bad, attendants are very rude, if you call for an attendant during the flight no one comes. They only focus on business calls, the seats are uncomfortable the entertainment system has no choice of movies very limited, they need to update. We thought the Air India since being taken over by Tata were expecting some good changes but its getting bad, they need to make some changes."
